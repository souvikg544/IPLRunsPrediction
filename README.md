## Machine Learning Backend
### Data Preprocessing

- We take the historic ipl data from 2008 till 2020 having all thr matches with columns/features 
like scores per ball, batsman , bowler and several others.
- Being from the ipl site , it required extensive data cleaning and data processing including outlier removal, feature scaling and feature importance decisions.
